# Internship Projects at Cognorise Infotech

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing various data science projects I've worked on. Below are brief descriptions of each project along with the key methodologies and tools used.

## Projects

### 1. Car Price Prediction
In this project, I developed a model to predict car prices based on various features such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, and more.

**Key Techniques and Tools:**
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Decision Trees, Random Forest
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Model Evaluation (RMSE, MAE)

### 2. Shopper Sentiment Analysis
This project involved analyzing customer reviews to determine the sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) and gain insights into customer satisfaction.

**Key Techniques and Tools:**
- Text Data Preprocessing
- Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes)
- Python (NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)


### 3. Fake News Detection
Built a model to detect fake news articles using various machine learning techniques.

**Key Techniques and Tools:**
- Text Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Extraction (TF-IDF, Word Embeddings)
- Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM)
- Python (NLTK, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
